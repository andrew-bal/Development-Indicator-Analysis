# World Development Indicators - SQL and Visualisation


**Introduction**

The enclosed Jupyter Notebook contains SQL queries made using a dataset about world development indicators. The dataset contains information about different countries, such as their GDP, CO2 emissions, unemployment rate, etc. More complex query results are visualised using Python. The notebook serves the purpose of showcasing different types of SQL queries and combining these with Python.


**Problem Statement**

The notebook answers questions such as the following:

Which countries are above the average CO2 emission in Europe and Central Asia?
What is the level of central government debt of European Union member states in 2012?
What are the countries with the highest GDP per capita per year from 2000 to 2014?
What is the distribution of land area of South Asian countries?


**Approach**

After creating a connection to the database, I made SQL queries, gradually increasing in complexity. The queries include merging tables, subqueries, CTEs (Common Table Expressions) and aggregate functions. Some results are also visualized using Seaborn.
